**Today's Progress**: `#100DaysOfHardware` Day 1

I've set up a `@docusaurus`  site to gather my knowledge over there.

- Inventory of my current available items and components
- Project ideas to stay on track
- Project instructables on how to recreate them
- My tutorials on the hardware I already own

**Thoughts**: It's nice to get started with a clear state of mind, with some goals in mind of what I want to achieve. I have the base building blocks, I'm looking forward to see what I can make out of them.

**Today's Progress**: `#100DaysOfHardware` Day 2

📚 I spent time revisiting the basics from what I've learned in Electronics class in high school

🧠 I added a Theory tutorial section

🩹 I embedded a plain simple Resistor Band Color calculator into the site

🛠️ I revisited how to use the multimeter

**Thoughts**: I spent way too much time implementing that calculator, but now I have better sections, and I can add any react code from now on.

**Today's Progress**: `#100DaysOfHardware` Day 3

📚 I finished going through my inventory and added a page for all items

🖋️ I started to look into how to connect the eink display to raspberry pi

💾 I collected and reviewed some demo source code for testing it out later

**Thoughts**: It was a loooong day

**Today's Progress**: `#100DaysOfHardware` Day 4

🗺️ I've started to put together a simpler project to practice how I'll work through my ideas

🚦 This project is just going to check status info from the network and light up LEDs accordingly

🛹 I've sketched the code and planned the circuit diagram

**Thoughts**:
